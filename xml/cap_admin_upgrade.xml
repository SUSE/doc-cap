  &productname; upgrades are delivered as container images from the &suse;

  <title>Important Considerations</title>

  <para>
   Before performing an upgrade, be sure to take note of the following:
  </para>


  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Perform Upgrades in Sequence</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      &cap; only supports upgrading releases in sequential order. If there are
      any intermediate releases between your current release and your target
      release, they must be installed. Skipping releases is not supported.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Preserve &helm; Value Changes during Upgrades</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      During a <command>helm upgrade</command>, always ensure your
      &values-filename; file is passed. This will
      preserve any previously set &helm; values while allowing additional
      &helm; value changes to be made.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term><command>helm rollback</command> Is Not Supported</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      <command>helm rollback</command> is not supported in &productname; or in
      upstream &cf;, and may break your cluster completely, because database
      migrations only run forward and cannot be reversed. Database schema can
      change over time. During upgrades both pods of the current and the next
      release may run concurrently, so the schema must stay compatible with the
      immediately previous release. But there is no way to guarantee such
      compatibility for future upgrades. One way to address this is to perform a
      full raw data backup and restore. (See
      <xref linkend="sec-cap-backup-restore-of-raw-data"/>)

  <para>
   The supported upgrade method is to install all upgrades, in order. Skipping
   releases is not supported. This table matches the Helm chart versions to
   each release:
  </para>

  &releases-table;

  <para>
   Use <command>helm list</command> to see the version of your installed release
   . Verify the latest release is the next sequential release from your
   installed release. If it is, proceed with the commands below to perform the
   upgrade.
  </para>
 
  <para>
   The following procedure will upgrade &productname; 2.0 to &productname;
   &productnumber;.
  </para>

  <procedure>
   <step>
    <para>
     Begin by upgrading &operator;.
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;helm upgrade <replaceable>cf-operator</replaceable> suse/cf-operator \
--namespace <replaceable>cf-operator</replaceable> \
--set "global.operator.watchNamespace=<replaceable>kubecf</replaceable>" \
--version &operator_chart;
</screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
    Wait until &operator; is successfully upgraded before proceeding. Monitor
    the status of your &operator; upgrade using the <command>watch</command>
    command.
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;watch --color &apos;kubectl get pods --namespace <replaceable>cf-operator</replaceable>&apos;</screen>

   <step>
    <para>
     When the &operator; upgrade is completed, upgrade &kubecf;.
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;helm upgrade <replaceable>kubecf</replaceable> suse/kubecf \
--namespace <replaceable>kubecf</replaceable> \
--values &values-file; \

    <para>
     Monitor the status of your &kubecf; upgrade using the <command>watch</command>
