 <para>
&productname; (&cap;) is a software platform for cloud-native application
deployment based on &susecf; and &suse; &caasp; 2.0. It serves different but complementary
purposes for operators and application developers.
 </para>
 <para>
For operators, the platform is:

<para>
The principle interface and API for deploying applications to &productname; is
&susecf;. Most Cloud Foundry distributions run on virtual machines managed by
&bosh;. &susecf; runs in SUSE Linux Enterprise containers managed by &kube;.
Containerizing the components of the platform itself has these advantages:
</para>

 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Improves fault tolerance. &kube; monitors the health of all containers, and
    automatically restarts faulty containers faster than virtual machines can be
    restarted or replaced.
   </para>
</listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Reduces physical memory overhead. &susecf; components deployed in
    containers consume substantially less memory, as host-level operations are
    shared between containers by &kube;.
   </para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

   <para>
&susecf; packages upstream Cloud Foundry &bosh; releases to produce containers
and configurations which are deployed to &kube; clusters using &helm;.
</para>
<sect1 xml:id="sec.cap.architecture">
  <title>&productname; Architecture</title>

<para>
This guide details the steps for deploying &susecf;
on &suse; &caasp; 2. &caasp; is a specialized application development and 
hosting platform built on the &susemicros; container host operating system, 
container orchestration with &kube;, and &salt; for automating installation and
configuration. 
</para>

<important>
        <title>Review the &suse; &caasp; Deployment Guide</title>
        <para>
        Setting up &susecf; correctly depends on setting up &suse; &caasp;
        correctly. Review the 
        <link xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/documentation/suse-caasp-2/">&suse; &caasp; Deployment Guide</link> 
        to understand how it operates, and basic configuration and administration 
        options.
    </para>
</important>

<para>
A supported deployment includes &susecf; installed on &caasp; 2. You also 
need a storage backend, such as &ses;, a DNS server, and an Internet connection 
to download additional packages during installation and ~10GB of Docker images 
on each &kube; minion after installation.
</para>
<para>
A production deployment requires considerable resources. &productname; includes 
an entitlement of &suse; &caasp; 2 and &ses; 5. &ses; alone has substantial
requirements; see the 
<link xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/products/suse-enterprise-storage/">Tech Specs</link>
for details. &suse; &caasp; requires a minimum of four nodes: one admin and three
&kube; nodes. &susecf; is then deployed on the &kube; nodes. 
</para>


<para>
The minimum 4-node deployment is not sufficient for a production deployment,
but it is enough for a compact test deployment, which you can run virtualized 
on a single workstation or laptop. <xref linkend="cha.cap.install-production"/> 
details a basic production deployment, and <xref linkend="cha.cap.install-minimal"/> 
describes a minimal test deployment.
