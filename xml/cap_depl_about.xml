  <title>About &productname;</title>
 </info>
 <para>
&productname; is a software platform for cloud-native application
deployment based on &scf; and &suse; &caasp; 2.0. It serves different but complementary
purposes for operators and application developers.

<para>
The principle interface and API for deploying applications to &productname; is
&scf;. Most Cloud Foundry distributions run on virtual machines managed by
&bosh;. &scf; runs in SUSE Linux Enterprise containers managed by &kube;.
Containerizing the components of the platform itself has these advantages:
</para>

 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Improves fault tolerance. &kube; monitors the health of all containers, and
    automatically restarts faulty containers faster than virtual machines can be
    restarted or replaced.
   </para>
</listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Reduces physical memory overhead. &scf; components deployed in
    containers consume substantially less memory, as host-level operations are
    shared between containers by &kube;.
   </para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

   <para>
&scf; packages upstream Cloud Foundry &bosh; releases to produce containers
and configurations which are deployed to &kube; clusters using &helm;.
</para>

<sect1 xml:id="sec.cap.architecture">
  <title>&productname; Architecture</title>

<para>
This guide details the steps for deploying &scf;
on &suse; &caasp; 2. &caasp; is a specialized application development and 
hosting platform built on the &susemicros; container host operating system, 
container orchestration with &kube;, and &salt; for automating installation and
configuration. 
</para>

<important>
        <title>Review the &suse; &caasp; Deployment Guide</title>
        <para>
        Setting up &scf; correctly depends on setting up &suse; &caasp;
        correctly. Review the 
        <link xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/documentation/suse-caasp-2/">&suse; &caasp; Deployment Guide</link> 
        to understand how it operates, and basic configuration and administration 
        options.
    </para>
</important>

<para>
A supported deployment includes &scf; installed on &caasp; 2. You also 
need a storage backend, such as &ses;, a DNS server, and an Internet connection 
to download additional packages during installation and ~10GB of Docker images 
on each &kube; worker after installation.
</para>
<para>
A production deployment requires considerable resources. &productname; includes 
an entitlement of &suse; &caasp; 2 and &ses; 5. &ses; alone has substantial
requirements; see the 
<link xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/products/suse-enterprise-storage/">Tech Specs</link>
for details. &suse; &caasp; requires a minimum of four nodes: one admin and three
&kube; nodes. &scf; is then deployed on the &kube; nodes. 
</para>
<para>
Note that after you have deployed your cluster and start building and running
applications, your applications may depend on buildpacks that are not bundled
in the container images that ship with &scf;. These will be downloaded at
runtime, when you are pushing applications to the platform. Some of these 
buildpacks may include components with proprietary licenses.
</para>

<para>
The minimum 4-node deployment is not sufficient for a production deployment,
but it is enough for a compact test deployment, which you can run virtualized 
on a single workstation or laptop. <xref linkend="cha.cap.install-production"/> 
details a basic production deployment, and <xref linkend="cha.cap.install-minimal"/> 
describes a minimal test deployment.

  <title>New in Version 1.1</title>
  <para>
      These are some of the changes in the 1.1 release. See the Release Notes
      for a complete list, and known issues. See <xref linkend="sec.cap.update"/>
      for upgrade instructions.

            &productname; 1.1 supports Azure Container Service (AKS).

    <para>
	Stratos UI 1.1 is required for SUSE Cloud Application Platform 1.1, and older 
    version will not work. Use the same 
    <filename>scf-config-values.yaml</filename> file for both.
</para>
 </listitem>
 <listitem>
     <para>
         The Helm command line client must be version 2.6.0 or higher.
     </para>
 </listitem>
 <listitem>
     <para>
     There are some changes in the <filename>scf-config-values.yaml</filename>
     configuration file. The variable <varname>kube.external_ip</varname> has 
     been changed to <varname>kube.external_ips</varname>. Upgrades from 
     older versions will fail unless the latter variable exists in the 
     <filename>scf-config-values.yaml</filename> file. Both variables can exist 
     at the same time, and be set to the same value for those in mixed version 
     environments.
 </para>
 <para>
     For example, when upgrading enter both variables in 
     <filename>scf-config-values.yaml</filename>:
 </para>
 <screen>
kube.external_ip=1.1.1.1
kube.external_ips=[1.1.1.1]
</screen>
<para>
    Going forward, <varname>kube.external_ips</varname> is an array, like this example:
    </para>
    <screen>
kube.external_ips=["1.1.1.1", "2.2.2.2"]
</screen>
</listitem>
<listitem>
    <para>
        All the secrets have been renamed from env.FOO to secrets.FOO, so all 
        the appropriate entries in <filename>scf-config-values.yaml</filename> 
        must be modified to align with that change.
    </para>
    <para>
        You must specify your secrets on each upgrade (e.g. the 
        <varname>CLUSTER_ADMIN_PASSWORD</varname>) as they won't be carried forward automatically.
    </para>
    <para>
        To rotate secrets, increment the <code>kube.secret_generation_counter</code>. 
        (Please note: immutable generated secrets will not be reset.)
    </para>

    <para>
        Some roles (like diego-api, diego-brain and routing-api) are configured 
        as active/passive, so passive pods can appear as Not Ready. Other roles 
        (tcp-router and blobstore) cannot be scaled.
    </para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
    <para>
    A Helm upgrade command from 1.0 to 1.0.1 (scf 2.6.11 to 2.7.0) requires the 
    <command>--force</command> to drop an unnecessary persistent volume. Note 
    that <command>helm upgrade</command> only works for multi-node clusters 
    when running with a proper HA storage class (e.g. hostpath will not work as 
    required stateful data can be lost).
