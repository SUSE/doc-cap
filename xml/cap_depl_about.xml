  <title>&productname; Overview</title> 
 <para>
&productname; is a software platform for cloud-native application
deployment based on &scf; and &suse; &caasp;. It serves different but complementary
purposes for operators and application developers.
 </para>

<para>
The principle interface and API for deploying applications to &productname; is
&scf;. Most Cloud Foundry distributions run on virtual machines managed by
&bosh;. &scf; runs in SUSE Linux Enterprise containers managed by &kube;.
Containerizing the components of the platform itself has these advantages:
</para>

 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Improves fault tolerance. &kube; monitors the health of all containers, and
    automatically restarts faulty containers faster than virtual machines can be
    restarted or replaced.
   </para>
</listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Reduces physical memory overhead. &scf; components deployed in
    containers consume substantially less memory, as host-level operations are
    shared between containers by &kube;.
   </para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

   <para>
&scf; packages upstream Cloud Foundry &bosh; releases to produce containers
and configurations which are deployed to &kube; clusters using &helm;.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 xml:id="sec.cap.architecture">
  <title>&productname; Architecture</title>

<para>
This guide details the steps for deploying &scf;
on &suse; &caasp;, and on supported environments such as Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). &caasp; is a specialized application development and 
hosting platform built on the &susemicros; container host operating system, 
container orchestration with &kube;, and &salt; for automating installation and
configuration. 
</para>

<important>
        <title>Review the &suse; &caasp; Deployment Guide</title>
        <para>
        Setting up &scf; correctly depends on setting up &suse; &caasp;
        correctly. Review the 
        <link xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/documentation/suse-caasp-2/">&suse; &caasp; Deployment Guide</link> 
        to understand how it operates, and configuration and administration 
        options. You should understand basic Linux, &docker;, and &kube;
        administration and use.
    </para>
</important>

<para>
A supported deployment includes &scf; installed on &caasp;. You also 
need a storage backend, such as &ses;, a DNS/DHCP server, and an Internet connection 
to download additional packages during installation and ~10GB of Docker images 
on each &kube; worker after installation.
</para>

<para>
A production deployment requires considerable resources. &productname; includes 
an entitlement of &suse; &caasp; and &ses;. &ses; alone has substantial
requirements; see the 
<link xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/products/suse-enterprise-storage/">Tech Specs</link>
for details. &suse; &caasp; requires a minimum of four hosts: one admin and three
&kube; nodes. &scf; is then deployed on the &kube; nodes. Four &caasp; nodes are
not sufficient for a production deployment. 
<xref linkend="fig.cap.min-prod-arch"/> describes a minimal production deployment 
with &scf; deployed on a &kube; cluster containing 
three &kube; masters and three workers, plus an ingress controller, administration
workstation, DNS/DHCP server, and a &ses; cluster.
</para>

<para>
The minimum 4-node deployment is sufficient for a compact test deployment, which 
you can run virtualized on a single workstation or laptop. 
<xref linkend="cha.cap.install-production"/> 
details a basic production deployment, and 
<xref linkend="cha.cap.install-minimal"/> 
describes a minimal test deployment.
</para>

<para>
Note that after you have deployed your cluster and start building and running
applications, your applications may depend on buildpacks that are not bundled
in the container images that ship with &scf;. These will be downloaded at
runtime, when you are pushing applications to the platform. Some of these 
buildpacks may include components with proprietary licenses. (See
<link xlink:href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/developing-buildpacks.html">Customizing and Developing Buildpacks</link> to learn more
about buildpacks, and creating and managing your own.)
