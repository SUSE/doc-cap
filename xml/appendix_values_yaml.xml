  # - uaa: The UAA is the identity management service for Cloud Foundry. It's
  #   primary role is as an OAuth2 provider, issuing tokens for client
  #   applications to use when they act on behalf of Cloud Foundry users. It can
  #   also authenticate users with their Cloud Foundry credentials, and can act
  #   as an SSO service using those credentials (or others). It has endpoints
  #   for managing user accounts and for registering OAuth2 clients, as well as
  #   various other management functions.
