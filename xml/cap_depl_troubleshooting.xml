 <para>
     Cloud stacks are complex, and debugging deployment issues often requires
     digging through multiple layers to find the information you need. Remember 
     that the &scf; releases must be deployed in the correct order, and that 
     each release must deploy successfully, with no failed pods, before deploying
     the next release.
 </para>

 <title>Using Supportconfig</title>
 <para>
     If you ever need to request support, or just want to generate detailed 
     system information and logs, use the <command>supportconfig</command>
     utility. Run it with no options to collect basic system information, and 
     also cluster logs including Docker, etcd, flannel, and Velum. <command>supportconfig</command> may give you all the information you need.
 </para>
 <para>
     <command>supportconfig -h</command> prints the options. Read the "Gathering System Information for Support" chapter in any &sle; Administration Guide 
     to learn more.

    <title>What is Taking So Long?</title>
    <para>
        A deployment step seems to take too long, or you see that some 
        pods are not in a ready state hours after all the others are ready, or a 
        pod shows a lot of restarts. This example shows not-ready pods many
        hours after the others have become ready:
    </para>
    <screen>
&prompt.user;kubectl get pods --namespace scf
NAME                     READY STATUS    RESTARTS  AGE
router-3137013061-wlhxb  0/1   Running   0         16h
routing-api-0            0/1   Running   0         16h
</screen>

<para>
    The <literal>Running</literal> status means the pod is bound to a node and 
    all of its containers have been created. However, it is not 
    <literal>Ready</literal>, which means it is
    not ready to service requests. Use <command>kubectl</command> to
    print a detailed description of pod events and status:
</para>

<screen>
&prompt.user;kubectl describe pod --namespace scf router-3137013061-wlhxb
</screen>

<para>
    This prints a lot of information, including IP addresses, routine events, warnings, and errors. You should find the reason for the failure in this
    output.

    <para>
which means the original deployment configuration file is 
    incorrect. The configuration file must be corrected and UAA and SCF must 
    be deleted and re-deployed. Use <command>helm</command> to list your deployed releases, then delete them and start over:
</para>

<screen>
&prompt.user;helm ls
NAME REVISION UPDATED                  STATUS    CHART      NAMESPACE
suse-cf  1        Tue Apr 10 15:17:53 2018 DEPLOYED  cf-2.7.0   scf      
scf-uaa  1        Tue Apr 10 14:59:00 2018 DEPLOYED  uaa-2.7.0  uaa  

&prompt.user;helm delete suse-cf
