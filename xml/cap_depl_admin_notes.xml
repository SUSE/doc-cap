  <para>
   Different schedulers, such as Diego and Eirini, and different stacks, such as
   <literal>cflinuxfs3</literal> or <literal>sle15</literal>, have different
   memory requirements for applications. Not every combination is tested so
   there is no universal memory setting for &cap;, and because it depends on the
   application deployed, it is up to the user to adjust the setting based on
   their application.
