 <para>
  Eirini, an alternative to Diego, is a scheduler for the &cf; Application
  Runtime (CFAR) that runs &cf; user applications in &kube;. For details about
  Eirini, see <link xlink:href="https://www.cloudfoundry.org/project-eirini/"/>
  and <link xlink:href="http://eirini.cf"/>

  <title>Technology Preview</title>
  <para>
   Eirini is currently included in &productname; as a technology preview to
   allow users to evaluate. It is <emphasis>not</emphasis> supported for use in
   production deployments.
  </para>
  <para>
   As a technology preview, Eirini contains certain limitations to its
   functionality. These are outlined below:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     As of &scf; 2.18.0, <command>cf push</command> with Eirini does not work on
     &eks-full; and &gke-full; by default. To get <command>cf push</command> to work with
     &eks-full; and &gke;, you need to apply
     a workaround of deleting a webhook by doing the following:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;kubectl delete mutatingwebhookconfigurations eirini-x-mutating-hook-eirini</screen>
    <para>
     Deleting the webhook means that the <literal>eirini-persi</literal> service
     would not be available. Note that this workaround is not needed on &aks-full;.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Currently, Eirini is only compatible with the <literal>cflinuxfs3</literal> stack.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     <command>cf ssh</command> to applications is currently not working. As an
     alternative, SSH into the application pods via <command>kubectl</command>.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Restarting a cluster may result in the loss of application logs.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Air gapped environments or usage of manual certificates are currently not
     supported.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Eirini is not compatible with &kube; environments running CRI-O at this
     time. Please use &docker; runtime instead for now.

     To enable Eirini, and disable Diego, add the following to your
     <filename>scf-config-values.yaml</filename> file.

     Depending on your cluster configuration, Metrics Server need to be deployed
     . Use &helm; to install the latest stable Metrics Server.
    </para>
    <para>
     Note that <literal>--kubelet-insecure-tls</literal> is not recommended for
     production usage, but can be useful in test clusters with self-signed
     Kubelet serving certificates. For production, use
     <literal>--tls-private-key-file</literal>.
